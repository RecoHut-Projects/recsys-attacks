        "Recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users to find their interested information in various web services such as Amazon, YouTube, and Google News. Various recommender systems, ranging from neighborhood-based, association-rule-based, matrix-factorization-based, to deep learning based, have been developed and deployed in industry. Among them, deep learning based recommender systems become increasingly popular due to their superior performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommendation Systems (RS) have become an essential part of many online services. Due to its pivotal role in guiding customers towards purchasing, there is a natural motivation for unscrupulous parties to spoof RS for profits.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the advancement of recommender systems, various techniques are employed to influence the output of recommender systems to promote or demote a particular product. Attacks are the inserting of bogus data into a recommendation system. Collaborative Filtering based Recommender Systems are the most sensitive systems to attacks in which malicious users insert fake profiles into the rating database in order to bias the system’s output (these types of attacks are known as profile injection or Shilling attacks). Purpose of the attacks can be different: to push(push attack)/decrease(nuke attack) some items’ ratings by manipulating the recommender system, manipulation of the “Internet opinion” or simply to sabotage the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The attacks technique is to create numerous fake accounts / profiles and issue high or low ratings to the “target item”.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general description of the profile of a true user and fake user are characterized as 80% unrated items and 20% rated items for the “true” profile\" , whereas “fake”\" profile consists of 20% unrated items and 80% rated (target items + selected items + filler items). From above description of trusted and fake user profile it is clear that to attack a recommender system, attack profile need to be designed as statistically identical to genuine profile as possible."

        "\n",
        "a.k.a. fake data injection. Injects fake users with carefully crafted ratings to a recommender system. These fake data will be included in the training dataset of the target recommender system and then poisons the training process. In case of item promotion as a goal, these injected ratings would maximize the number of normal users to whom the target items are recommended. \n",
        "\n",
        "Recommendation engines are prone to performance alteration by malicious users that might be able to poison the training data with hand-engineered, and machine-learning optimized, fake user profiles (shilling profiles). An attacker's goal is to manipulate a recommender system such that the attacker-chosen target items are recommended to many users. To achieve this goal, the attack injects fake users with carefully crafted ratings to a recommender system.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to whether data poisoning attacks are focused on a specific type of recommender system, we can divide them into two categories: algorithm-agnostic and algorithm-specific. The former (e.g., types of shilling attacks like random attacks and bandwagon attacks) does not consider the algorithm used by the recommender system and therefore often has limited effectiveness. For instance, random attacks just choose rated items at random from the whole item set for fake users, and bandwagon attacks tend to select certain items with high popularity in the dataset for fake users. The algorithm-specific data poisoning attacks are optimized to a specific type of recommender systems and have been developed for graph-based recommender systems, association-rule-based recommender systems, matrix-factorization-based recommender systems, and neighborhood-based recommender systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data poisoning attacks pose severe threats to the trustworthiness of recommender systems and could manipulate Internet opinions. For instance, if an attacker manipulates a news recommender system such that a particular type of news are always recommended to users, then the attacker may be able to manipulate the users’ opinions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Profile pollution\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike the data poisoning attack, profile pollution attack is done at the testing time. It pollutes the historical behavior of normal users. It relies on cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and only applicable to item-to-item recommender systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Image spoofing\n",
        "\n",
        "In this attack, images of a category of low recommended products (e.g., socks) are perturbed to misclassify the deep neural classifier towards the class of more recommended products (e.g., running shoes) with human-level slight images alterations."
